\section{Space debris problem}

The rising population of space debris is threat to the satellites. Many non-controlled objects are orbiting the Earth. We need to know the trajectory and position of these objects to minimize possibility of collision with satellites. Cataloguing these objects can help us to prevent unnecessary collisions by moving satellites in advance. \cite{silha2019development}
